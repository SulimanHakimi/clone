                  How to build minimum lovable products
                </h1>
                <p class="p">
                  Building great products is hard. Most new products fail. But
                  what if there was a way to improve your chances of success? In
                  his book "The Lean Product Playbook," entrepreneur and Lean
                  product expert Dan Olsen lays out a repeatable, easy-to-follow
                  methodology for iterating your way to product-market fit. I
                  recently read the book and shared my notes and understanding
                  in a webinar, and I'm excited to share the key takeaways with
                  you in this blog post.
